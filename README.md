# EloTunes

EloTunes is a web application that allows you to rate your music library and discover your favorite songs. The app uses
an Elo score system to sort your playlists, so you can easily find and listen to your favorite tunes.

## Current State

EloTunes was created by me as a personal project.
At the moment the application is in its earliest stages of development and barely working. I'm still trying things out
and adding new features.

## Local Development

If you want to start the app yourself, you will need a MusicKit developer token and edit the Firebase config.

Run `yarn install` and then `yarn dev`. The app will then run on port 3000.
