# Elo Music Rating

A web application for rating music. The core idea is to give you a choice between two songs, you choose the one you prefer.
The songs have an Elo score associated with them which is updated every time you rate a song. Over time the Elo score will
reflect the songs you like the most, so you can export them to a new, ordered playlist.

## Current State

At the moment the application is in its earliest stages of development. I'm still trying things out and adding new features.

## Local Development

If you want to start the app yourself, you will need a MusicKit developer token and edit the Firebase config.

Run `npm install` and then `npm start`. The app will then run on port 3000.
